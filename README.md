# Interactive-Plot

Monte Carlo simulations on the interactions between mono-energetic proton beams with water were performed. The Energy deposited along Z- axe (Bragg peak) was scored and the results were plotted for analysis.
A program in python using OOP in a Jupyter Notebook environment was implemented for data analysis of the CSV files. Is worthing to mention that this can be used to load N number of CSV files by initializing the class N times.

The class load a single CSV file and check for NaN values in it and perform cleaning if necessary. The output of the program is an interactive plot which shows the Bragg peak for each proton energy used in this study.

As expected, the position of the Bragg Peak increases proportionally with the input energy.
